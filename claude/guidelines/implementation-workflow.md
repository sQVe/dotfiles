# Implementation workflow

_During implementation: Tracking and communication_

### Task tracking for complex work

**Essential for multi-step work** - track progress with specific task items, clear status updates, and completion checkmarks.

**When to use task tracking:**

- Features requiring 3+ distinct steps
- Non-trivial implementations with multiple components
- Debugging complex issues with multiple potential causes
- Refactoring that affects multiple files or systems

**How to structure tasks:**

- Break down into specific, actionable items
- Mark tasks as in_progress before starting work
- Complete tasks immediately after finishing - don't batch
- Add follow-up tasks as you discover them

### Implementation notes

**For complex implementations, consider keeping simple notes:**

- **Context:** Why this was needed and key requirements
- **Key decisions:** Important choices made and rationale
- **Lessons learned:** Unexpected issues and discoveries
- **Testing approach:** How you verified the implementation works

**Testing integration:** Test as you build, not after completion.

### Project coordination

**Use Linear MCP for development workflow:**

- Create and track development tasks and features
- Link code changes to specific issues or requirements
- Manage bug reports and feature requests
- Coordinate work across team members
- Track progress on larger initiatives

**When to use Linear:**

- Starting new features or major changes
- Reporting and tracking bugs found during development
- Coordinating work that affects multiple people
- Planning and organizing complex projects
- Documenting requirements and acceptance criteria
