# Commit Command

Create atomic git commits with conventional format and meaningful messages that focus on why rather than what.

## Usage
```
/commit [commit-message]
```

## Instructions
You are helping create clean, atomic git commits with meaningful messages. Follow these steps:

1. **Prepare changes** by reviewing current state and grouping related modifications into logical units

2. **Create conventional commits** with appropriate staging and meaningful messages explaining why

3. **Verify commit history** ensuring clean progression and no uncommitted changes

## Examples
```bash
# Create commits for current changes
/commit

# Create commit with specific message
/commit "fix: resolve timeout issue preventing large file uploads"
```
