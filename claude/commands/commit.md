Commit the changes following these steps:

1. **Analyze changes**: Run `git status` and `git diff` to review all modifications.
   - Understand the scope of modifications.
   - Group related changes for logical commits.

2. **Validate code**: Run linting, type checking, and tests before committing.
   - Execute linting commands for code quality.
   - Run type checking to ensure type safety.
   - Execute test suite to verify functionality.

3. **Create commits**: Use Conventional Commits format (`type: description`).
   - Types: feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor, test
   - Use imperative mood, limit first line to 72 characters
   - **Be concise**: Focus on why, not what files changed
   - **No file listings**: Avoid enumerating changed files
   - Create multiple logical commits when necessary

4. **Get approval**: Always wait for my approval before creating a commit.

Follow CLAUDE.md guidelines for commit message format and quality standards.
