# Universal Development Guidelines

Essential principles for all development work. Use `@claude/commands/` for specific tasks.

## Core Principles

_Non-negotiables that override everything else_

- **Research first** - Find current best practices and patterns
- **Ask clarifying questions** - Never assume requirements or edge cases
- **Understand existing patterns** - Analyze codebase structure and conventions
- **Simplicity first** - Remove everything non-essential
- **Single responsibility** - Each function/class/module does one thing well
- **Write obvious code** - No clever tricks, maintainable by anyone
- **Validate before completion** - Never say "done" without verification
- **Handle all errors explicitly** - No silent failures, proper logging required
- **Make incremental changes** - Small, focused, testable commits
