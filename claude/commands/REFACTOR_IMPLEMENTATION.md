# Claude Commands Refactoring Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document captures all decisions, patterns, and improvements agreed upon during the command refactoring process.

## Core Principles

### UNIX Philosophy
- **Do one thing well**: Each command has a single, focused responsibility
- **No validation overlap**: Validation is handled by separate commands/processes
- **Composable**: Commands can be combined as needed without conflicting responsibilities

### Self-Contained Value Test
Every command must pass this critical test to ensure UNIX philosophy compliance:

- **Clear Problem**: Solves one specific, complete problem with clear value proposition
- **No Dependencies**: Can be used effectively without running other commands first
- **Complete Solution**: Provides full solution to the problem, not just part of a workflow
- **Standalone Value**: Would be useful even if no other commands existed

**Test Questions for Each Command:**
- "Can I run this command cold and get complete value?"
- "Does this solve a real problem someone would have?"
- "Is this command useful on its own, or does it require other commands to be meaningful?"

**Examples:**
- ✅ `debug:production "authentication errors"` - Complete production debugging from scratch
- ✅ `plan:feature "real-time notifications"` - Complete feature planning without prerequisites
- ❌ `debug:isolate` - Requires prior information gathering, not self-contained

### Language Consistency
- **Singular vs Plural**: Use singular when command creates one specific thing (`Create a pull request`), plural when it can create multiple (`Create atomic commits`)
- **Action-focused**: Commands describe what they do, not general capabilities

## Category Structure

### Workflow Categories
1. **research** - Gathering information before coding
2. **plan** - Designing approach and breaking down work
3. **implement** - Writing/changing code
4. **validate** - Testing and verification (broader than just testing)
5. **finalize** - Wrapping up and packaging work
6. **debug** - Fixing problems and troubleshooting

### Category Guidelines
- **research vs debug**: Research is pre-coding investigation, debug is fixing broken things
- **implement vs validate**: Implement is building/changing code, validate is testing and verification
- **plan vs implement**: Plan is designing approach, implement is executing the changes
- **validate vs finalize**: Validate is ensuring quality, finalize is packaging completed work

## Command Structure Template

### Standard Sections
```markdown
# [Category]: [Command Name] Command

<instructions>
  <context>
    [Single focused sentence describing what the command does - ~15-25 words]
  </context>

  <requirements>
    - [3-5 essential prerequisites, specific and actionable]
  </requirements>

  <execution>
    1. **[Step name]**
       - [2-4 focused sub-points per step]

    2. **[Step name]**
       - [2-4 focused sub-points per step]

    3. **[Step name]**
       - [2-4 focused sub-points per step]
  </execution>

  <validation>
    - [ ] [5-7 focused validation items specific to the command's purpose]
  </validation>

  <examples>
    [2 practical examples: basic workflow + detailed template/structure]
  </examples>
</instructions>
```

### Length Guidelines
- **Target**: 40-60 lines total
- **Context**: 15-25 words maximum
- **Execution**: 3 steps with 2-4 sub-points each
- **Validation**: 5-7 focused items
- **Examples**: 2 scenarios maximum

## Specific Command Decisions

### Completed Refactoring

#### `finalize:commit.md`
- **Focus**: Creating atomic commits with good messages
- **Removed**: All validation responsibilities (lint, test, typecheck)
- **Key insight**: Commit command shouldn't run validation - separate concern
- **Language**: "Create atomic commits" (plural - can create multiple per invocation)

#### `research:prime.md`
- **Focus**: Providing codebase context (structure, history, documentation)
- **Transformed**: From environment setup to context analysis
- **Key insight**: Should read CLAUDE.md and other documentation for comprehensive context
- **Language**: "Analyze project structure" (analysis action)

#### `finalize:pr.md`
- **Focus**: Creating well-structured PRs with clear descriptions
- **Removed**: All code validation responsibilities
- **Key insight**: Template should show realistic test plan with specific reviewer instructions
- **Language**: "Create a pull request" (singular - one PR per invocation)
- **Template**: Uses "Test plan" section with specific manual testing steps for reviewers

#### `implement:issue.md` (formerly fix-issue.md)
- **Focus**: Implementing solutions for tracked issues (GitHub/Linear only)
- **Scope**: GitHub issues and Linear issues (removed direct descriptions)
- **Language**: "Implement a targeted solution" (not "fix" - covers features, chores, etc.)
- **Validation**: Includes debugging and validation tools (integral to the process)
- **User Input**: Uses $ARGUMENTS placeholder for issue numbers/IDs

#### `implement:resolve.md` (new command)
- **Focus**: General problem resolution from descriptions
- **Scope**: Natural language problem descriptions, not tied to issue trackers
- **Language**: "Implement a solution for the described problem"
- **Separation**: Complements implement:issue.md by handling ad-hoc problems

#### `research:external.md` (formerly research.md)
- **Focus**: External documentation and best practices research only
- **Transformed**: From broad research to focused external knowledge gathering
- **Removed**: Codebase analysis, requirements gathering, synthesis (moved to separate commands)
- **Key insight**: Clear separation between internal and external research

#### `validate:code.md` (from verify-changes.md)
- **Focus**: Code quality validation with auto-fixing capabilities
- **Scope**: Always validates entire codebase (no scope arguments required)
- **Features**: Linting, formatting, type checking with automated fixes where possible
- **Key insight**: Code quality validation should be comprehensive and automated

#### `validate:tests.md` (from verify-changes.md)
- **Focus**: Test execution and coverage analysis
- **Scope**: Supports "changes", "all", "unit", "integration" arguments for flexible testing
- **Features**: Test execution, coverage reporting, gap identification
- **Key insight**: Different test scopes needed for different validation strategies

#### `validate:functionality.md` (from verify-changes.md)
- **Focus**: Manual workflow testing, user experience validation, and accessibility compliance
- **Scope**: Requires specific features/workflows to test as arguments
- **Features**: User workflow testing, accessibility validation, responsive design testing, edge case validation
- **Key insight**: Manual testing requires specific scope to be effective; accessibility naturally belongs with UX validation
- **Enhancement**: Added comprehensive accessibility checks (ARIA, keyboard navigation, screen reader, responsive design)

#### `validate:quality.md` (from verify-changes.md)
- **Focus**: Security, performance, and maintainability analysis
- **Scope**: Accepts specific file/component or "all" for comprehensive analysis  
- **Features**: Security vulnerability scanning, technical debt assessment, performance bottleneck identification
- **Key insight**: Quality analysis should be pure diagnostic tool, separate from planning improvements
- **Senior dev perspective**: Added error handling, observability, removed accessibility (moved to functionality validation)

## Naming Conventions

### File Naming
- Format: `category:command-name.md`
- Use hyphens for multi-word commands
- Keep command names concise and action-focused

### Command Categories Applied
- `research:prime.md` - Project context gathering
- `research:external.md` - External documentation research
- `research:codebase.md` - Internal pattern analysis
- `plan:requirements.md` - Requirements gathering
- `plan:synthesis.md` - Research synthesis and planning
- `finalize:commit.md` - Packaging commits
- `finalize:pr.md` - Creating pull requests
- `implement:issue.md` - Resolving tracked issues
- `implement:resolve.md` - General problem resolution
- `validate:code.md` - Code quality and linting validation
- `validate:tests.md` - Test execution and coverage analysis
- `validate:functionality.md` - Manual workflow and user experience testing
- `validate:quality.md` - Security, performance, maintainability analysis
- `plan:improvements.md` - Actionable improvement recommendations
- `plan:workflow.md` - Contextual workflow guidance and next command suggestions

### Command Validation Framework
- **Conflict Detection**: Ensure commands don't overlap in scope by testing problem statements
- **Completion Criteria**: Each command must provide actionable output without requiring follow-up
- **Migration Strategy**: Deprecate broad commands only after focused alternatives are proven

## Key Insights and Patterns

### Validation Separation
- **Rule**: Commands don't run validation unless it's integral to their core purpose
- **Exception**: `implement:issue.md` and `implement:resolve.md` need debugging/validation to know if problem is resolved
- **Principle**: Trust the user, compose with other commands as needed

### User Input Handling
- **Standard**: Use `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder for dynamic input
- **Pattern**: Commands accept natural language or specific identifiers
- **Command Naming**: Use colons in command invocation to match filenames (e.g., `validate:code.md` → `/validate:code`)
- **Examples**: `/implement:issue #923`, `/research:external "JWT best practices"`

### Template Examples
- **PR Template**: Show realistic content with specific test plans
- **Test Plan**: List specific actions reviewers can take to validate changes
- **Focus**: Practical, actionable guidance over generic checklists

### Content Reduction
- **Average reduction**: 40-50% fewer lines
- **Method**: Remove redundancy, focus on core purpose, reference existing guidelines
- **Quality**: Maintained essential functionality while improving usability

### Content Reuse Success
- **Original research.md** (117 lines) split into 4 focused commands:
  - `research:external.md` (60 lines) - External documentation
  - `plan:requirements.md` (58 lines) - Requirements gathering
  - `research:codebase.md` (60 lines) - Pattern analysis
  - `plan:synthesis.md` (58 lines) - Implementation planning

### Total Target: 22 Focused Commands
This approach eliminates all broad, multi-purpose commands in favor of specific, self-contained tools that each solve one complete problem following UNIX philosophy.

## Implementation Framework

### Applying Self-Contained Test to New Commands

When creating each new command, validate against the framework:

1. **Problem Statement**: Can you complete this sentence clearly?
   - "I want to [specific action] because [specific problem]"
   - Example: "I want to debug production errors because something is failing in prod"

2. **Standalone Test**: Would this command be useful if no other commands existed?
   - ✅ Yes: User gets complete value from this single command
   - ❌ No: Command requires other commands to be meaningful

3. **Scope Boundaries**: Does the command have clear start and end points?
   - ✅ Clear: Takes problem description, provides complete solution
   - ❌ Unclear: Partial workflow step that requires follow-up

### Command Creation Priority

**Phase 1**: Complete verify-changes.md breakdown
- `validate:quality.md` (next)
- `plan:improvements.md`

**Phase 2**: Debug category (high value, clear problems)
- `debug:production` (Sentry MCP integration)
- `debug:performance` (performance bottleneck analysis)
- `debug:reproduce` (issue validation)
- `debug:analyze` (general debugging)

**Phase 3**: Plan and track extensions
- `plan:feature` (complex feature planning)
- `plan:project` (project organization)
- `track:progress` (progress updates)
- `track:issues` (issue management)

**Phase 4**: Implementation completion
- `implement:refactor` (code improvement)
- `implement:feedback` (PR feedback response)
- `implement:tdd` (test-driven development)

## Success Metrics & Migration

### Success Criteria
- **Adoption**: Focused commands used more than original broad commands
- **Efficiency**: Reduced time to complete common workflows
- **Clarity**: Users understand what each command does without reading docs
- **Composability**: Users naturally combine commands for complex workflows

### Common Command Patterns
- **Feature Development**: `research:external` → `plan:feature` → `implement:*` → `validate:*` → `finalize:*`
- **Bug Investigation**: `debug:production` → `implement:resolve` → `validate:functionality`
- **Code Quality**: `validate:code` → `plan:improvements` → `implement:refactor`

### Migration Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Complete core validation and planning commands
2. **Phase 2**: Create debug category commands (high user value)
3. **Phase 3**: Add remaining implementation and tracking commands
4. **Phase 4**: Deprecate original broad commands after 2-week trial period

## Recent Improvements (July 2024)
