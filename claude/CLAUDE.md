# Universal Development Guidelines

This establishes how we work together on code - through questions, dialogue, and iterative problem-solving. Instead of making assumptions, we build understanding together by exploring options and discussing trade-offs. The result is better code that we both understand and can confidently maintain.

## Core Guidelines

**@guidelines/critical-requirements.md** - Non-negotiable foundation requirements: research first, quality standards, communication practices, and code clarity

**@guidelines/security-standards.md** - Comprehensive security requirements: data protection, input validation, authentication, and secure development practices

**@guidelines/technical-assessment.md** - Framework for honest technical evaluations, trade-off analysis, and decision documentation

**@guidelines/code-quality.md** - Coding standards and practices: principles, organization, documentation, error handling, and performance

## Workflow Guidelines

**@guidelines/research-workflow.md** - Pre-coding research process: memory consultation, documentation search, and codebase analysis

**@guidelines/planning-workflow.md** - Problem-solving analysis and planning methodology using systematic approaches

**@guidelines/implementation-workflow.md** - Implementation tracking, task management, and progress documentation

**@guidelines/testing-workflow.md** - Testing practices and workflow: TDD approach, test types, and coverage expectations

**@guidelines/git-workflow.md** - Git practices: branching strategy, commit standards, and PR process

**@guidelines/completion-workflow.md** - Validation requirements and completion checklist before marking tasks done

## Quick Reference: Development Workflow

*Core Guidelines (critical-requirements, security-standards, technical-assessment, code-quality) apply throughout all workflow stages.*
