Refactor $ARGUMENTS:

1. **Analyze current code**: Understand existing implementation and identify improvements.
2. **Plan refactoring**: Design the new structure while preserving behavior.
3. **Implement incrementally**: Make small, testable changes with full test coverage.
4. **Validate behavior**: Ensure no functionality changes during refactoring.

Follow CLAUDE.md guidelines for code quality and testing standards.
