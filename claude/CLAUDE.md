# Universal Development Guidelines

This establishes how we work together on code - through questions, dialogue, and iterative problem-solving. Instead of making assumptions, we build understanding together by exploring options and discussing trade-offs. The result is better code that we both understand and can confidently maintain.

## Core Guidelines

**@guidelines/critical-requirements.md** - Non-negotiable foundation requirements: research first, quality standards, communication practices, and code clarity.

**@guidelines/security-standards.md** - Comprehensive security requirements: data protection, input validation, authentication, and secure development practices.

**@guidelines/technical-assessment.md** - Framework for honest technical evaluations, trade-off analysis, and decision documentation.

**@guidelines/code-quality.md** - Coding standards and practices: principles, organization, documentation, error handling, and performance.

**@guidelines/documentation-workflow.md** - Documentation creation and maintenance: when to document, writing principles, organization, and tools.

## Workflow Guidelines

_These guidelines follow the recommended development sequence from initial research through completion._

1. **@guidelines/research-workflow.md** - Pre-coding research process: memory consultation, documentation search, and codebase analysis.

2. **@guidelines/planning-workflow.md** - Problem-solving analysis and planning methodology using systematic approaches.

3. **@guidelines/testing-workflow.md** - Testing practices and workflow: TDD approach, test types, and coverage expectations.

4. **@guidelines/implementation-workflow.md** - Implementation tracking, task management, and progress documentation.

5. **@guidelines/git-workflow.md** - Git practices: branching strategy, commit standards, and PR process.

6. **@guidelines/completion-workflow.md** - Validation requirements and completion checklist before marking tasks done.
