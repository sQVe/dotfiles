# Profile Command

Identify and analyze performance bottlenecks using profiling tools and systematic performance analysis.

## Usage
```
/profile <performance-issue-description>
```

## Instructions
You are helping analyze performance issues to identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities. Follow these steps:

1. **Profile and measure** system performance using appropriate tools to identify CPU, memory, database, and network bottlenecks

2. **Analyze root causes** of performance issues including code patterns, database queries, and external dependencies

3. **Recommend prioritized optimizations** with specific implementation strategies and expected performance gains

## Examples
```bash
# Analyze API response time issues
/profile "API response times degraded after recent changes"

# Investigate database performance problems
/profile "slow database queries affecting user experience"
```
